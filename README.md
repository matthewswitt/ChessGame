# ChessGame
Developed a chess game in C++ using OOP principles taught in CS 246.

Includes a single player mode where you can play different level CPU's: easy, medium and hard. The game also supports standard two player mode.

Prior to a game, the user has the option to enter setup mode, which is a mode where you can customize the starting board for the next game so you do not have to start every game with a default chess board.

Below shows a game created with a default chess board with a human player as white and computer level 1 as black. The first few moves are shown. To make a CPU move, the command is simply 'move' when it is their turn. Note that since the video is a .gif file everything looks slower.
